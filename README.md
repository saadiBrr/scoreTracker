A basic score tracking website for cricket matches. 

Features include:

Customizable team and player names

Option to change formats between tests (no sixes outside of free hits, 4 innings) and T20

Option to set match rules such as max bouncers per over and max overs per innings

Supports 2 teams of up to 3 players each, each player can have up to 5 wickets. 

Extras are credited to the batters and are tracked individually.

Bouncers past the max bouncer limit will result in an automatic no ball, resulting in a free hit. Bouncers can be picked before the start of a game, ranging from 0 per over to 2 per over.
